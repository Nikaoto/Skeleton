# Skeleton
This is a custom Skeleton fork designed to make bootstrapping a new website quick for me and other 
users of Kartvelian languages.

You can find the original Skeleton at https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton


## Getting started
`git clone https://github.com/Nikaoto/Skeleton.git`


## Included Content
Major additions include the Georgian [BPG Arial](https://web-fonts.ge/bpg-arial) font and a 
`normalize.min.css` (v8.0) customized for Georgian typefaces.

`main.css` is deliberately left empty.
