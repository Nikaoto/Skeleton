# Skeleton
This is a custom Skeleton fork designed to make bootstrapping a new website quick for me and other 
users of Kartvelian languages.

## Getting started
`git clone https://github.com/Nikaoto/Skeleton.git`

## Included Content
My boilerplate includes everything needed for quickly creating a simple static website.

Major additions include the Georgian BPG WEB 001 font and a custom normalize.min.css (v8.0).
