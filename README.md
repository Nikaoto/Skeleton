# Skeleton
This is a custom Skeleton fork designed to make bootstrapping a new website quick for me and other 
users of Kartvelian languages.

You can find the original Skeleton at https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton


## Getting started
Clone the repository and start working without a hitch:
```
git clone https://github.com/Nikaoto/Skeleton.git
```


## Included Content
Major additions include the Georgian [BPG Arial](https://web-fonts.ge/bpg-arial) font and a 
`normalize.min.css` (v8.0) customized for Georgian typefaces.

```
Skeleton/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   ├── bpg-arial.css
│   ├── normalize.min.css
│   ├── skeleton.css
│   └── main.css
├── images/
│   └── favicon.png
└── fonts/
    ├── bpg-arial.woff
    └── bpg-arial.woff2

```

`index.html` includes sample code and `main.css` is deliberately left empty.

Both are there to help you jump into a new project with minimal friction. 

`skeleton.css` also has some minor compatibility changes including a `ka` 
selector which you can put on any tag to enable the included Georgian font.
